# Tuwaiq Data Science Camp Proposal

## Overview

In this project, I want to perform some exploratory data analysis and build one or more machine learning models that can predict what is the amount of gold and copper in geological samples gathered from defrent locations and what are the minerals that can be found in these locations based on the chemical analysis results of these samples.

## Data

The data set for this project is a chemical analysis dataset extracted by analyzing some geological samples collected by geologists from different locations in my work field, in excel file and it need some data cleaning before the data set is ready.
