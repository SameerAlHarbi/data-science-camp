# Chemical Analysis AI Model

Sameer Mohammed Al Harbi

## abstract

The goal of this project is to create a linear regression machine learning model that predict the missing results and fill the gabs that caused by a chemeical anaysis devices in a chemical analysis report extracted by analyzing some valuable geological samples collected by geologists from different locations in my work field, 

## Data

The data set for this project is a chemical analysis dataset extracted by analyzing some geological samples collected by geologists from different locations in my work field, in excel file and it need some data cleaning before the data set is ready.


## Modele 

* linear regression model

## tools

I am using a python programming language for AI development along with its libraries 
for example :

- Numpy for data manipulation
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn  for modeling
- Matplotlib for plotting.
- seaborn for plotting.

And other libraries that might be helpful in modeling algorithms to achieve my goal.
